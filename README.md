# riemann-cookbook

## Requirements

Depends on the yum and [graphite](https://github.com/hw-cookbooks/graphite)
cookbooks. Targets Amazon Linux and CentOS, but should work for any RHEL
derivative.

## Usage

Make sure you set the `node[:riemann][:version]` (current version is 0.2.4) and
`node[:graphite][:web_server]` attributes.

## Attributes

```
node[:riemann][:version] -- What version of riemann you'd like installed
```

## Recipes

### default.rb

Will re-create the riemann config from template/attributes. Calls install.rb

### install.rb

As it says on the tin, installs riemann and graphite on the server.
